\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Ass. Prof. Geir Olav Dyrkolbotn for providing excellent guidance, assistance and support during this thesis. I especially appreciate how my supervisor has facilitated guidance from me as a distance student at NTNU.

A big thank goes to my employer BDO AS, and especially Ingunn Holte and Håkon Lønmo, for allowing me time to research, study and write my thesis while working full-time.

I highly appreciate all motivation and support from friends and family throughout my studies. I especially couldn't have done this without my partner Cecilie which has supported me through all ups and downs along the way. I would also like to mention our son Arthur who never failed to cheer me up when I was stuck or met an obstacle during my writing of this thesis.
